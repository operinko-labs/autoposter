# Deploying autoposter

## Database

The app needs `AUTOPOSTER_DATABASE_URL` pointing at a PostgreSQL database it owns
(nothing else should write to it). Migrations run automatically at container
startup (`alembic upgrade head`), so no manual migration step is needed.

## Volumes

Mount the same NFS shares Posterizarr and Kometa already use today, at these
paths:

- `/assets`
- `/manualassets`
- `/assetsbackup`

These correspond to `assets_root`, `manual_assets_root` and `backup_root` in
`autoposter.yaml`.

## Secrets

Secrets come from an ExternalSecret providing the `AUTOPOSTER_*` environment
variables:

- `AUTOPOSTER_DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTOPOSTER_PLEX_TOKEN`
- `AUTOPOSTER_TMDB_TOKEN`
- `AUTOPOSTER_TVDB_APIKEY`
- `AUTOPOSTER_FANART_APIKEY`
- `AUTOPOSTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `AUTOPOSTER_MDBLIST_APIKEY` — optional. Unset, only the `content_rating`
  metadata field is skipped; every other metadata operation (ratings, genres,
  studio, release date) still runs (see `app.py`'s `_build_mdblist`).

None of these are read from the YAML config file.

## Metadata operations config

The `operations:` block in `autoposter.yaml` controls the per-item metadata
writes added in Phase 2a (ratings, content rating, genres, studio, release
date — replacing Kometa's `mass_*_update`):

- `enabled` (default `true`) — off means metadata operations do not run at
  all; artwork rendering is unaffected either way.
- `write_to_plex` (default `true`) — off means facts are still gathered and
  stored in `item_facts`, but nothing is written to Plex. The safe setting
  while the tool being replaced (Kometa) still owns these fields.
- `imdb_refresh_hours` (default `6`) — how often the IMDb ratings dataset is
  polled in the background; see "Loading IMDb ratings" below.
- `imdb_refresh_enabled` (default `true`) — off disables the automatic
  refresh entirely, for operators who prefer to run it by hand.
- `imdb_miss_refresh_minutes` (default `60`) — rate limit for the
  miss-triggered refresh described below. `0` disables it.

See `config/autoposter.example.yaml` for the full block.

## Loading IMDb ratings

`critic_rating` (IMDb) is populated from IMDb's bulk datasets, not a live API
call. The app polls these automatically in the background: once at startup if
`imdb_ratings` is missing or older than `imdb_refresh_hours` (default 6),
then every `imdb_refresh_hours` after that. The refresh runs as a background
task — like the Plex health probe — so it never blocks startup or the
request/worker loop, even while parsing the ~60 MB datasets.

IMDb rebuilds these datasets once a day, around 00:38–00:39 UTC. Polling
every 6 hours (rather than the previous 24h, which could sit up to a full day
behind a publication) picks up each day's build within 6 hours.

Most of those polls transfer nothing: the request is conditional
(`If-Modified-Since`), and datasets.imdbws.com replies `304 Not Modified` with
no body when the file hasn't changed since the last successful refresh, so
the download and the parse are both skipped. This is tracked per dataset
(ratings and episodes independently, since their id sets differ), and the
skip is safe *only* when this library's set of wanted IMDb ids also hasn't
changed since that refresh — a poll still re-downloads and re-parses an
otherwise-unchanged file if the library gained titles since the last refresh,
because `refresh()` only stores rows for ids it was asked about and would
otherwise silently leave a newly imported title unrateable forever. Check the
`imdb:` log lines to see, per poll, whether each dataset downloaded (and how
many rows it stored) or was skipped and why.

The one behaviour operators will still notice: a title imported since the
last refresh has no IMDb rating until the next poll runs, so a newly added
film's `critic_rating` can lag by up to `imdb_refresh_hours`. This is
expected, not a bug — set `imdb_refresh_hours` lower if that lag is a
problem, or see "Miss-triggered refresh" below for the mechanism that
usually catches this sooner.

### Miss-triggered refresh

To shrink that blind spot, fact gathering also retries once whenever a
rating lookup finds nothing: it attempts an immediate refresh scoped to just
that one IMDb id, then re-checks, so a freshly imported title can get its
`critic_rating` on the same pass instead of waiting up to
`imdb_refresh_hours`. It only pulls what that one lookup needs — a movie or
show miss downloads just `title.ratings.tsv.gz` (8.6 MB); only an *episode*
miss also downloads `title.episode.tsv.gz` (54 MB), to learn the new
episode's own IMDb id first.

This is rate-limited to one attempt per `imdb_miss_refresh_minutes` (default
60), tracked in the database (`imdb_miss_refresh_state`) rather than in
memory, so every pod behind the same database shares one cooldown window —
importing a season pack triggers at most one download, not one per episode.
Set `imdb_miss_refresh_minutes: 0` to disable it entirely.

A title that is genuinely unrated — a same-day release, or an episode that
hasn't aired yet — will still show a blank `critic_rating` after the retry.
That is correct behaviour, not a fault: IMDb has no rating to give it until
it has votes.

To force a refresh immediately (e.g. for a first load before the app has run,
or after changing which titles are in the library) rather than waiting for
the next interval, run the same loader by hand:

```
python -m autoposter.facts.imdb
```

This needs only `AUTOPOSTER_DATABASE_URL` in the environment. It selects the
IMDb ids the library actually needs from `media_items`, downloads and parses
both datasets, upserts `imdb_ratings`/`imdb_episodes`, and prints how many
rating and episode rows were stored.

## Obtaining AUTOPOSTER_PLEX_TOKEN

Run the PIN-based login flow instead of extracting a token from a browser
URL:

```
python -m autoposter.plex.auth
```

This prints an `https://app.plex.tv/auth#?...` URL — open it in a browser and
sign in to authorise autoposter. The command then polls plex.tv and prints
the resulting token once authorisation completes, together with a reminder
that it belongs in `AUTOPOSTER_PLEX_TOKEN`.

The token grants full access to the Plex account it was issued for (not just
this library), so store it only in the secret manager backing the
`AUTOPOSTER_PLEX_TOKEN` ExternalSecret — never in the config file, a
`.env` file, or anywhere else. To rotate it, run the command again; pass
`--client-identifier` with the value printed by the previous run if you want
the new token to update the same "Authorized Devices" entry in the Plex
account rather than adding a new one.

## Radarr / Sonarr webhooks

Configure Radarr and Sonarr with a webhook notification pointing at this
service's webhook URL (`/webhook/radarr` and `/webhook/sonarr` respectively),
with a custom header `X-Autoposter-Token` set to the same value as
`AUTOPOSTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Enable these triggers:

- **Radarr:** On Import Complete, On Rename, On Movie Add
- **Sonarr:** On Import Complete, On Rename, On Series Add

## Recovering parked jobs

A job moves to `state='parked'` once it has been retried
`config.plex.resolve_max_attempts` times (Plex-connectivity failures and
"Plex hasn't scanned this yet") or `MAX_ATTEMPTS` times (everything else)
without succeeding. Parked jobs are not retried automatically — there is no
endpoint, script, or sweep that unparks them in this phase, so a Plex outage
longer than the attempt budget silently and permanently drops the affected
webhooks unless someone requeues them by hand.

A Plex outage itself should no longer be the cause, though: job claiming is
gated on a periodic Plex liveness check (`plex/health.py`), so while the
server is known unhealthy jobs stay `pending` and untouched instead of being
claimed and burning attempts. The retry budget above is now only a fallback
for an outage that begins between health checks.

Use this only after confirming the underlying problem (e.g. Plex) is fixed —
requeuing while the cause is still broken just burns through the attempt
budget again and re-parks the same jobs.

Requeue every parked job:

```sql
UPDATE jobs
   SET state = 'pending',
       claimed_by = NULL,
       claimed_at = NULL,
       attempts = 0
 WHERE state = 'parked';
```

Requeue only jobs parked within a time window (e.g. the last 2 hours, to
avoid resurrecting something parked for an unrelated, still-unresolved
reason):

```sql
UPDATE jobs
   SET state = 'pending',
       claimed_by = NULL,
       claimed_at = NULL,
       attempts = 0
 WHERE state = 'parked'
   AND updated_at > now() - interval '2 hours';
```

## ImageMagick build

The image is built on Alpine because its ImageMagick is **Q16-HDRI**, matching
the Posterizarr deployment this service replaces. This is not cosmetic: a Q16
build without HDRI renders the same source 0.077% differently, so new artwork
would no longer be byte-identical to what is already in the asset tree. The
Docker build asserts the flag is present, so swapping the base image fails the
build rather than silently changing output.

HDRI also permits float-format source artwork (`.exr`, `.hdr`) to be dropped
into the manual-assets directory.

## Provider API keys

Each operator supplies their own keys; none are embedded in the image.
`AUTOPOSTER_FANART_APIKEY` is a personal key from your own fanart.tv account —
keep that account's email address current, as their terms require, since it is
how they would contact you about the key.
